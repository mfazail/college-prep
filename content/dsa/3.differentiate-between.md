1. How binay tree is different from binary search tree?

| Binary tree | Binary Search tree |
| -------| ----- |
| BINARY TREE is a nonlinear data structure where each node can have at most two child nodes.| BINARY SEARCH TREE is a node based binary tree that further has right and left subtree that too are binary search tree.|
|Data Representation is carried out in a hierarchical format.| Data Representation is carried out in the ordered format.|
|Binary trees allow duplicate values.| Binary Search Tree does not allow duplicate values.|
|Time complexity is usually O(n).| Time complexity is usually O(logn).|
|It is used for retrieval of fast and quick information and data lookup.| It works well at element deletion, insertion, and searching.|

2. Binary search vs linear search.

| Binary Search | Linear Search |
| -------| ----- |
|In binary search input data need to be in sorted order.|In linear search input data need not to be in sorted.|
|It is also called half-interval search.|It is also called sequential search.|
|The time complexity of binary search O(log n).|The time complexity of linear search O(n).|
|Only single dimensional array is used.|Multidimensional array can be used.|
|Binary search performs ordering comparisons|Linear search performs equality comparisons|
|It is more complex.|It is less complex.|
|It is very fast process.|It is very slow process.|

3. Array vs linked list.

| Array | Linked list |
| -------| ----- |
|Arrays are stored in contiguous location.| Linked list are not stored in contiguous location.|
|Fixed in size |Dynamic in size|
|Memory is allocated at compile time |Memory is allocated at run time|
|Uses less memory than linked lists. |Uses memory because it stores both data and the address of next node.|
|insertion and deletion takes time |Insertion and deletion operation is faster.|

4. Linked list vs doubly linked list

| Linked list | Doubly linked list |
| -------| ----- |
|node contains 2 field-data field and next link field. | node contains 3 fields-data field, a previous link field and a next link field.|
| occupies less memory than DLL as it has only 2 fields.|  occupies more memory than SLL as it has 3 fields.| 
|We mostly prefer to use singly linked list for the execution of stacks.| We can use a doubly linked list to execute heaps and stacks, binary trees.|
|When we do not need to perform any searching operation and we want to save memory, we prefer a singly linked list.| In case of better implementation, while searching, we prefer to use doubly linked list.|
