**1. Write an algorithm for conversion of an infix artimetic expression in its corresponding postfix form.**

**2. Convert the following infix expression to corresponding postfix expression:**<br>
`(A+B)/C*E+F$G-H/(I*J)`

**3. Convert the following infix expression to corresponding postfix expression:**<br>
`4+3*10/6+7-4/2+5^3`

**4. Consider the following sequence of binary tree traversals:**<br>
Inorder: Q,B,K,C,F,A,G,P,E,D,H,R<br>
Preorder: G,B,Q,A,C,K,F,P,D,E,R,H<br>
Hence, construct the binary tree.


**5. Construct the binary search tree if the elements are in the order:**<br>
60,75,25,66,50,55,45,40,35,57,30

Delete the following nodes in order and show each step:<br>
i.Node with 55<br>
ii.Node with 66<br>
iii.Node with 50<br>

**6. Consider the following sequence of binary tree traversals:**<br>
Inorder: B C E D F A G H<br>
Preorder: A B C D E F G H<br>
Hence, construct the binary tree.

**7. Construct the binary search tree with the following nodes and do inorder, preorder, postorder traversal of this tree:**<br>
24, 35, 9, 29, 41, 50

Delete node with value 35 from this tree.

**8. Construct an AVL tree with the following nodes:**<br>
34,67,4,56,44,55,671,345,567,2,89,93,23
Show all the steps.
