**1. What is abstract data type(ADT)? Explain with example.**

An Abstract Data Type in data structure is a kind of a data type whose behavior is defined with the help of some attributes and some functions. Generally, we write these attributes and functions inside a class or a structure so that we can use an object of the class to use that particular abstract data type.
Examples of abstract data types in data structure are list, stack, queue etc.

If we consider the smartphone. We look at the high specifications of the smartphone, such as:
4 GB RAM, Snapdragon 2.2ghz processor, 5 inch LCD screen, Dual camera, Android 8.0.

The above specifications of the smartphone are the data, and we can also perform the following operations on the smartphone:

```
call(): We can call through the smartphone.
text(): We can text a message.
photo(): We can click a photo.
video(): We can also make a video.
```
The smartphone is an entity whose data or specifications and operations are given above. The abstract/logical view and operations are the abstract or logical views of a smartphone.

**2. What is circular queue? what are its advantages?**

Circular Queue is a linear data structure that follows FIFO (first in first out) principle which means the item that is inserted first in the queue will be taken out first.  It is also known as circular/ring buffer because the last position of the queue is circled back and connected with the first element thereby, forming a circular structure.

_Advantages of Circular Queue:_

- It provides a quick way to store FIFO data with a maximum size.
- Efficient utilization of the memory.
- Doesnâ€™t use dynamic memory.
- Simple implementation.
- All operations occur in O(1) constant time.


**3. What is stack? Explain with an example.**

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. 


**4. What is hashing? How is collison problem solved in hashing?**

Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.

_There are mainly two methods to handle collision:_

- **Separate Chaining:**  It is implemented using linked lists. This method combines a linked list with a hash table in order to resolve the collision. In this method, we put all the elements that hash to the same slot in the linked list.

- **Open Addressing:** Here all elements are stored in the hash table itself. So at any point, the size of the table must be greater than or equal to the total number of keys

**5. Sparse matrix**

A matrix is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and n columns, therefore having total m x n values. If most of the elements of the matrix have 0 value, then it is called a sparse matrix.

_Two to use Sparse Matrix instead of simple matrix:_

- **Storage:** There are lesser non-zero elements than zeros and thus lesser memory can be used to store only those elements.
- **Computing time:** Computing time can be saved by logically designing a data structure traversing only non-zero elements.

**6. B-tree**

B-Tree is a self-balancing search tree. In most of the other self-balancing search trees (like AVL and Red-Black Trees), it is assumed that everything is in the main memory. The main idea of using B-Trees is to reduce the number of disk accesses. It is a fat tree.

_Time complexity of B-Tree:_

|Sr. No.	|Algorithm	|Time Complexity|
| -------| ----- |-------|
|1.	|Search	|O(log n)|
|2.	|Insert	|O(log n)|
|3.	|Delete	|O(log n)|


**7. Quick sort**

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. 

_There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways._

- Always pick the first element as a pivot.
- Always pick the last element as a pivot (implemented below)
- Pick a random element as a pivot.
- Pick median as the pivot.

**8. Avl tree**

AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which each node maintains extra information called a balance factor whose value is either -1, 0 or +1. AVL tree got its name after its inventor Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis. Balance factor of a node in an AVL tree is the difference between the height of the left subtree and that of the right subtree of that node.

**9. What is recursion? How does it differ from iteration?**

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, etc.

|Recursion|Iteration|
|----|-----|
|Terminates when the base case becomes true.|	Terminates when the condition becomes false.|
|Used with functions.|	Used with loops.|
|Every recursive call needs extra space in the stack memory.|	Every iteration does not require any extra space.|
|Smaller code size.|	Larger code size.|
