#### Super, Subclass, final keyword, constructor, etc


#### Constructor

Constructor enables an object to initialize itself when it is created. Consructors have the same name as the class itself and they don't specify a return type not even void.

```java

class Hello{

	String message;

	Hello(String msg){ // 👈🏻 Constructor
		message = msg;
	}

}

```

#### sub class
A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class)

```java
class Bird {

}
// 	  👇🏻 sub class
class Crow extends Bird{

}
```


#### super class
The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class)

```java
// 	  👇🏻 super class
class Bird {

}

class Crow extends Bird{

}
```


#### Multilevel inheritance/hierarchy

```java
class Bird {

}
// 	  👇🏻 One level 
class Omnivore extends Bird{
	//An omnivore is an animal that has the 
	// ability to eat and survive on 
	// both plant and animal matter.
}
// 	  👇🏻 Two level 
class Crow extends Omnivore{

}
```

#### super, final keyword and super() method

1. Super is a keyword of Java which refers to the immediate parent of a class and is used inside the subclass method definition for calling a method defined in the superclass.

```java
class Employee {
	int wt = 8;
}

class Clerk extends Employee {
	int wt = 10;  //work time
	void display() {
		System.out.println(super.wt); // 👈🏻
		//will print work time 8 of clerk
	}

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Clerk c = new Clerk();
		c.display();
	}
}
```

2. Final is a keyword in Java that is used to restrict the user and can be used in many respects. Final can be used with:
	- Class
	- Methods
	- Variables

3. super() method is used to call/access the parent class constructor.


#### Abstract class and methods

A class which is declared as abstract is known as an **abstract class**. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

```java
abstract class A{}
```

A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an **abstract method**.

```java
abstract void printStatus();//no method body and abstract 
```


#### dynamic method dispatch

It is used to implement runtime polymorphism.

```java
class S{
	void method(){}
}
class Sub extends S{
	void method(){}
}
class DMethodExp{
	public static void main(String[] args){

		S ins = new Sub();
		ins.method();
		// Sub method will be called
	}
}
```

#### Interface

An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods. It cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class.

```java
public interface Drawable{
	void draw();
}
```

#### Diff b/w Abstarct and interface

| Abstract | Interface |
|----------|-----------|
|Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.|	Interface supports multiple inheritance.|
|The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.|	The interface keyword is used to declare interface.|
|An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends".|	An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements".|
