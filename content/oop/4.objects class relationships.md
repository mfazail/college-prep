title: 'Objects Class Relationships'

- Object: Objects are the basic runtime entities in an object-oriented system. Object is an instance of a class.
- Class: Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.


#### Relationship among objects

Association relationship indicates how objects know each other and how they are using each other’s functionality. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many.

- Two Forms of Association

1. Composition

It is a “belongs-to” type of association. It simply means that one of the objects is a logically larger structure, which contains the other object. In other words, it’s part or member of the larger object. Alternatively, it is often called a “has-a” relationship.

2. Aggregation 

Aggregation is also a “has-a” relationship, but, what distinguishes it from composition, is that the lifecycles of the objects are not tied. Both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity. Both of them can exist independently of each other. Therefore, it is often referred to as week association. 

#### Diff b/w Aggregation and composition


| S.No.|	Aggregation | Composition |
|---------|--------| -----|
| 1.	|Association between two objects that illustrate the “has-a” relationship is called Aggregation. |	A composition defines a part-of a relationship, and both the entities are connected to each other.|
| 2.	|Here the objects are independent of each other.|	Here, the objects are dependent on each other.|
| 3.	|In the case of Aggregation, the child object will remain in the system even if we remove the parent object.|	In the case of Composition, the child object will get deleted if we delete the parent object.|
| 4.	|We can define Aggregation through a filled diamond.|	We can define composition through an empty diamond.|
| 5.	|Aggregation is a strong association |	Composition is a strong association|
| 6.	|In Aggregation, children have their own lifetime.|	In Composition, children don’t have their own lifetime.|
