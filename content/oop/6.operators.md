#### Operators in Java

1. Arithmetic operators

It is used to construct mathematical expressions as in algebra.

| + 	   | Addition or unary plus |
| - 	   | Substraction or unary minus |
| * 	   | Multiplication |
| / 	   | Division |
| % 	   | Modulo Division (Remainder) |

2. Relational operators

It is used to compare two values. 

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| <		   | is less than |
| <=	   | is less than or equal to |
| > 	   | is greater than |
| >=	   | is greater than or equal to |
| ==	   | is equal to |
| !=	   | is not equal to |

3. Logical operators

Similar functionality as relational operator 

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| &&	   | logical AND |
| ||	   | logical OR |
| !	  	   | logical NOT |

4. Assignment opertaor

It is used to assign the value of an expression to a varibale.

```java
// Examples
int a = 7;
	 👆🏻
int a += 7;
	  👆🏻
```

5. Increament and Decreament opertaor

Increament adds 1 to the operand while Decreament substract 1.

```java
// Examples
int a = 7;
a++;
++a;

--a;
a--;

```

6. Conditional(Ternary) opertaor

It is used to construct conditional expressions.

```java
int a = 7;
int x = 0;

x = (a > 3) ? 5 : 9;
// if a > 3 put a = 5 else a = 9

```
