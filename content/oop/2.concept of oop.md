### Concepts of object oriented programming language

The four basic concepts of object-oriented programming are inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation.

#### 1. Inheritance

It is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of objects of another class.

```
Ex: class Bird -> class Crow extends Bird
			   -> class Sparrow extends Bird
```

#### 2. Polymorphism

Polymorphism means the ability to take more than one form. It is the ability of object oriented programming to do some work using multiple forms.

```
Ex: static int Multiply(int a, int b) 
	static int Multiply(double a, double b) 
```

#### 3. Abstraction

Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explainations.

```
Ex: we know the way of using smartphone but we don't know how it works under tha hood.
```

#### 4. Encapsulation

The wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit(called class) is known as encapsulation.

```
Ex: Information "in" -> (Data & methods) -> Information out
```
