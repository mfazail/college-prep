#### Class and object properties

`this` keyword -  The this keyword can be used to refer current class instance variable. If there is ambiguity between the instance variables and parameters, this keyword resolves the problem of ambiguity.

`call by value` - Call by Value means calling a method with a parameter as value. Through this, the argument value is passed to the parameter. 

`call by refrence` -  Call by Reference means calling a method with a parameter as a reference. Through this, the argument reference is passed to the parameter.

`static variable` - The static variable is a class level variable and it is common to all the class objects i.e. a single copy of the static variable is shared among all the class objects.

`static methods` - A static method manipulates the static variables in a class. It belongs to the class instead of the class objects and can be invoked without using a class object.

#### Array

An array is group of related data items that share a common name.

```java
arr[10];
```
