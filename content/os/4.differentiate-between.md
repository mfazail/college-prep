#### Differentitate Betweens

**Logical vs Physical Address**

| Parameter | Logical Address | Physical Address |
|------|-----|-------|
|Basic|	generated by CPU|	location in a memory unit
|Visibility| User can view the logical address of a program. |	User can never view physical address of program.|
|Generation|	generated by the CPU|	Computed by MMU
|Access|	The user can use the logical address to access the physical address.|	The user can indirectly access physical address but not directly.|
|Editable |	Logical address can be change. | Physical address will not change.
|Also called |	virtual address.|	real address.|
|Address Space|	Logical Address Space is set of all logical addresses generated by CPU in reference to a program.|	Physical Address is set of all physical addresses mapped to the corresponding logical addresses.|

**Trap vs Interrupt**
|Trap|	Interrupt|
|-----|-------|
|It is a synchronous process.|	It is an asynchronous process.|
|All traps are interrupt.|	Not all the interrupts are traps.|
|It may happen only from the software devices.|	It may happen from the hardware and software devices.|
|A user program instruction generates it.|	Hardware devices generate it.|
|It is also known as a software interrupt.|	It is also known as a hardware interrupt.|
|The trap is a signal raised by a user program instructing the operating system to perform some functionality immediately.|	The interrupt is a signal to the CPU emitted by hardware that indicates an event that requires immediate attention.|

**Thread vs Process**
|Thread | Process|
|-----|-------|
|Thread means a segment of a process.|Process means any program is in execution.|
|The thread takes less time to terminate.|The process takes more time to terminate.|
|It takes less time for creation.|It takes more time for creation.|
|Thread is more efficient in terms of communication.|The process is less efficient in terms of communication.|
|A Thread is lightweight as each thread in a process shares code, data, and resources.|The process is called the heavyweight process.|

**Internal vs External Fragmentation**
|Thread | Process|
|-----|-------|
|Internal fragmentation happens when the method or process is smaller than the memory.|	External fragmentation happens when the method or process is removed.|
|The solution of internal fragmentation is the best-fit block.|	The solution to external fragmentation is compaction and paging.|
|Internal fragmentation occurs with paging and fixed partitioning.| 	External fragmentation occurs with segmentation and dynamic partitioning.|
|It occurs in worst fit memory allocation method.| 	It occurs in best fit and first fit memory allocation method.|

**Preemptive vs Non-preemptive Scheduling**
|Preemptive | Non-preemptive|
|-----|-------|
|Process can be interrupted in between.| Process can not be interrupted until it terminates itself or its time is up.|
|It has overheads of scheduling the processes.|	It does not have overheads.|
|Preemptive scheduling waiting time is less.| Non-preemptive scheduling waiting time is high.|
|cost associated|	no cost associated|
|In preemptive scheduling, CPU utilization is high.| It is low in non preemptive scheduling.|

**Context vs Process switching**
|Context | Process|
|-----|-------|
|Context switching occurs when a computer CPU switches from one process to another process.|Process switching is an operating system scheduler that changes from one running program to another program.|
|The Uses of Context switching to allow different process to run at the same time.|The Uses of Process switching saving all of the states of the currently executing program.|
|There are three situation of Context switching is necessary. Those: Multitasking Kernel,Switch,Interrupt.|In Process switching,all of the states of new program will be loaded then execution continue.|
|Context switching allows for one CPU to handle numerous processor or threat.|In Process switching have no such as function.|

**Deadlock vs Starvation**
|Deadlock | Starvation|
|-----|-------|
|All processes keep waiting for each other to complete and none get executed| High priority processes keep executing and low priority processes are blocked|
|Resources are blocked by the processes| Resources are continuously utilized by high priority processes|
|Necessary conditions Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No preemption, Circular Wait	|Priorities are assigned to the processes|
|Also known as Circular wait| Also known as lived lock|
|It can be prevented by avoiding the necessary conditions for deadlock| It can be prevented by Aging|
